    "**Model ensembling** is a class of techniques for aggregating together multiple different predictive algorithms into a meta-algorithm, which tends to increase accuracy and reduce overfitting. Ensembling approaches often work surprisingly well. Many winners of competitive data science competitions use model ensembling in [one](http://www.netflixprize.com/assets/GrandPrize2009_BPC_BellKor.pdf) [form](https://www.kaggle.com/c/amazon-employee-access-challenge/forums/t/5283/winning-solution-code-and-methodology) [or](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.0460.pdf) [another](https://medium.com/@chris_bour/6-tricks-i-learned-from-the-otto-kaggle-challenge-a9299378cd61#.utdq3qu1l). In previous tutorials, we discussed how tuning models allows you to get the best performance from individual machine learning algorithms. Here, we will take you through the steps of building your own ensemble for a classification problem, consisting of an individually optimized:\n",

    "1. Random forest (which is already itself an ensemble model)\n",
    "2. Support vector machine and\n",
    "3. Regularized logistic regression classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "These different models have quite different structures, which suggests they might capture different aspects of the dataset and could work well in an ensemble. We’ll continue working on the popular wine dataset, which captures chemical properties of wines and associated wine quality rankings. The goal is to predict wine quality from the chemical properties.  In this post, you'll use the following techniques to build model ensembles: **simple majority voting**, **weighted majority voting**, and model stacking/blending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Make sure you have the lastest version of `scikit-learn` (0.17.1) for the `import sklearn.ensemble.VotingClassifier` later in the tutorial. If not just upgrade `scikit-learn` with:\n",

    "## The motivation behind ensembling\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also fundamental reasons for why ensembling together different algorithms often improves accuracy, which is extremely well explained in [this Kaggle ensembling guide](http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/). Briefly, majority voting between models can correct errors in the predictions of individual models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea behind ensembling is this: different classes of algorithms (or differently parameterized versions of the same type of algorithm) might be good at picking up on different signals in the dataset.  Combining them means that you can model the data better, leading to better predictions. Furthermore, different algorithms might be overfitting to the data in various ways, but by combining them, you can effectively average away some of this overfitting. Furthermore, if you're trying to improve your model to chase accuracy points, ensembling is a more computationally effective way to do this than trying to tune a single model by searching for more and more optimal hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is best to ensemble together models which are less correlated, because then you can capture different aspects of the blog post (see an excellent explanation [here](http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/)). \n",

    "## Examples of ensemble learning\n",
    "You have probably already encountered several uses of model ensembling. **Random forests** are a type of ensemble algorithm that aggregates together many individual classification tree **base learners**. They are a good systems for intuitively understanding what ensembling is. [Explanation here]. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, a random forest is already an ensemble. But, a random forest will be just one model in the ensemble we build here. 'Ensembling' is a broad term, and is a recurrent concept throughout machine learning, but the general idea is that ensembling can correct the individual parts that may go wrong, and allow different models to capture different signals in the datasetm thereby improving overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re interested in **deep learning**, one common technique for improving classification accuracy is training different neural networks and getting them to vote on classifications for test instances. An ensemble-like technique for training individual neural networks is called dropout, and involves training different subnetworks during the same training phase. Combinging different models is a recurring trend in machine learning, different incarnations. If you’re familiar with **bagging** or **boosting** algorithms, these are very explicit examples of ensembling. "

    "There are plenty of ways to do model ensembling. Simple majority voting. We can also do weighted majority voting, where models with higher accuracy get more of a vote. If your output is numerical, you could average. These relatively simple techniques do a great job, but there is more! Stacking (also called blending) is when the predictions from different algorithms are used as input into another algorithm (often good old linear and logistic regression) which then outputs your final predictions. For example, you might train a linear model on the predictions. Blending. \n",
